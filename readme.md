  ## Description 
   * Motivation:
     Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.
   * Build information:
     I am building a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
   * Problem and solutions:
        Because this application won’t be deployed, I’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. I’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of my project. 
   * Knowledge:
    Application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.
